# Provision Generative AI Agents Service

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the steps to setup an OCI Generative AI Agent including ingesting a knowledge base from OCI Object Storage

Estimated Time: -- minutes

### About Generative AI Agents

OCI Generative AI Agents is a fully managed service that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with an intelligent retrieval system to create contextually relevant answers by searching your knowledge base, making your AI applications smart and efficient.

OCI Generative AI Agents supports several ways to onboard your data and then allows you and your customers to interact with your data using a chat interface or API. OCI Object Storage Service enables you to create Buckets. Once the Buckets are created, you can then upload your unstructured PDF manuals / documents in those buckets.
